            TaskMe was born out of the collective frustration of a group of
            passionate individuals who felt overwhelmed by the complexity of
            task management tools available in the market. We believe there had
            to be a better way, a simpler, more intuitive solution that could
            help individuals stay organized, productive and focused on what
            matters most.
